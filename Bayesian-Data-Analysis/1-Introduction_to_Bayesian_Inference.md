# Introduction to Bayesian Inference

## Thinking Like a Bayesian
**Study case**
- Student 1 writes down a number between 1 and 10.

- They mentally choose heads (H) or tails (T), and then a coin is flipped.

- If Student 1's mental guess matches the coin flip, they tell Student 2 honestly whether their number is even or odd.

- If their guess doesn't match the coin flip, they lie about the number being even or odd.

- Student 2 must then guess whether the number is even or odd, but they do not know if Student 1 is being honest or lying.

- We're interested in the probability, 𝜃, that Student 2 guesses correctly whether the number is odd or even.

Before starting the experiment:
1. What is the best guess for 𝜃?
    Because Student 2 doesn't know whether Student 1 telling the truth or not, the best guess is 50/50 which resulting in 𝜃=0.5 assuming to prior knowledge.
2. What is the probability that 𝜃 is greater than half?
    Without experimental data our best guess is 0.5 for 𝜃.
